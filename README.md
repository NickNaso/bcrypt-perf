# Bcrypt for Node.js

## Performance estimation between NAN and N-API implementation

Recently I worked on the porting of bcrypt for Node.js to the new **N-API** and 
now I created this repository to do some experiments to estimate the performance
against the previous version impelented with **NAN**.

## Environment

- Node.js Version **8.9.3**

- OS: macOS - High Sierra 

- MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)

- CPU 2,9 GHz Intel Core i5

- Memory 16 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3
