# Bcrypt for Node.js

## Performance estimation between NAN and N-API implementation

Recently I worked on the porting of bcrypt for Node.js to the new **N-API** and 
now I created this repository to do some experiments to estimate the performance
against the previous version impelented with **NAN**.
